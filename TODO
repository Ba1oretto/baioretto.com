build an ubuntu docker
write a postgresql setup post


tags is a field compound array
visual_suggestion is a string
suggestion is a field compound

1. assume the last idx is always editable.
2. when user input, update name in element, fetch the autocomplete result and clear visual_suggestion and suggestion
3. if result is null, do nothing
4. set suggestion to result, check user input equals name of suggestion
5. if not match, set visual_suggestion to the user input concat the rest of suggestion
6. if match with case insensitive, set visual_suggestion to name of suggestion
7. if match with case sensitive, set element with id and name of suggestion, and now it's not editable (which decided by whether id is not null)
8. push a new field compound to tags.
